# Script and data info:   This script performs pretreatment (factor analysis) followed by multivariate multiple linear regression of built environment and sociodemographic variables on transit ridership for a sample of tram and bus locations in Melbourne. 
# Data:                   Ridership data includes average normal (school) weekday ridership 
#                         Train, Tram ridership, averaged for 2018, by Victorian Department of Transport. 
#                         Bus ridership, averaged for 4 months from August - November 2018, provided by Chris Loader from the bus planning team at the Victorian Department of Transport

#This is the script for the first run through of factor and cluster analysis, involving
#modes: train/tram/bus
#variables: all
#unit of analysis: 800m (train)/600 (tram)/ 400 (bus)
#outlier: 
#Sampling: Generate clusters; sample from 'multimodal' clusters to achieve balanced covariates. # of stops to take from each cluster   constrained by the mode of which there is the least number of stops of that type in each cluster. Non-limiting modes are randomyl sampled from the clusters. 
#analysis method: Linear regression
